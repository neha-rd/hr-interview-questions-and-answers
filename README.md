>> Before we dive into HR questions, let's understand what is START method -
The STAR interview method gives you a simple framework to use when crafting your answers.
Here’s what STAR stands for:
- 1. **Situation**: Open with a brief description of the Situation and context of the success story (who, what, where, when, how).
- 2. **Task**: Explain the Task you had to complete highlighting any specific challenges or constraint (eg deadlines, costs, other issues).
- 3. **Action**: Describe the specific Actions that you took to complete the task. These should highlight desirable traits without needing to state them (initiative, intelligence, dedication, leadership, understanding, etc.)
- 4. **Result**: Close with the result of your efforts. Include figures to quantify the result if possible.

>>What are some tips on using the STAR Method?
Here are 5 good tips to keep in mind when using the STAR Method:
- 1. **Be prepared**. (Have your “success stories” picked out and prepared beforehand based on what the company is looking for.)
- 2. **Be specific**. (Don’t be wishy-washy. Being vague or general will not only make it difficult for the hiring manager to properly evaluate you, but it will dilute the impact of your success story.)
- 3. **Be quantitative**. ( Hiring Managers absolutely LOVE numbers, so have solid, tangible results to back up your stories.)
- 4. **Be concise**. (Keep your stories short, sweet and targeted.)
- 5. **Be honest**. (The last thing you want to do is dazzle your interviewer with a story that isn’t 100% true. It will come back to bite you.)

>> What are some mistakes to avoid when using the STAR Method?
Here are 5 mistakes you need to avoid when using the STAR Method:
- 1. Not answering the question at all.
- 2. Not being prepared. (Practice your success stories. Trying to use the star method on the spot is incredibly tough.)
- 3. Being too much prepared. (Obviously you need to prepare but don’t practice your answers to the point where you start to sound robotic. Try and keep things conversational.)
