# Collection of HR Interview Questions and Answers

> Before we dive into HR questions, let's understand what is START method -
The STAR interview method gives you a simple framework to use when crafting your answers.
Here’s what STAR stands for:
- 1. **Situation**: Open with a brief description of the Situation and context of the success story (who, what, where, when, how).
- 2. **Task**: Explain the Task you had to complete highlighting any specific challenges or constraint (eg deadlines, costs, other issues).
- 3. **Action**: Describe the specific Actions that you took to complete the task. These should highlight desirable traits without needing to state them (initiative, intelligence, dedication, leadership, understanding, etc.)
- 4. **Result**: Close with the result of your efforts. Include figures to quantify the result if possible.

> What are some tips on using the STAR Method?
Here are 5 good tips to keep in mind when using the STAR Method:
- 1. **Be prepared**. (Have your “success stories” picked out and prepared beforehand based on what the company is looking for.)
- 2. **Be specific**. (Don’t be wishy-washy. Being vague or general will not only make it difficult for the hiring manager to properly evaluate you, but it will dilute the impact of your success story.)
- 3. **Be quantitative**. ( Hiring Managers absolutely LOVE numbers, so have solid, tangible results to back up your stories.)
- 4. **Be concise**. (Keep your stories short, sweet and targeted.)
- 5. **Be honest**. (The last thing you want to do is dazzle your interviewer with a story that isn’t 100% true. It will come back to bite you.)

> What are some mistakes to avoid when using the STAR Method?
Here are 5 mistakes you need to avoid when using the STAR Method:
- 1. Not answering the question at all.
- 2. Not being prepared. (Practice your success stories. Trying to use the star method on the spot is incredibly tough.)
- 3. Being too much prepared. (Obviously you need to prepare but don’t practice your answers to the point where you start to sound robotic. Try and keep things conversational.)

> Tell me about an incident where you worked effectively under pressure.
- Throughout my career, I have done some of my best work under pressure. I find that routine makes us complacent, and I am always looking for challenges that push me to give my best and to quickly come up with working solutions.

One time I was supposed to deliver a project to a client in five days. A colleague who was working with another client had the same deadline, but he had to take a leave of absence due to personal reasons. I was forced to take up both projects at the same time, but I did not let the stress affect me. Instead, I came up with a very detailed time management plan and found new ways to boost my efficiency that enabled me to deliver both projects on time.

- I am able to thrive under multiple deadlines and projects. For example, I once had to work on three large projects that were all due in the same week. However, by prioritising my responsibilities, working effectively with my colleagues and putting in the extra effort, I was able to complete all three projects ahead of time and avoid any unnecessary stress.
